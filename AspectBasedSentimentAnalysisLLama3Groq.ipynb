              " 'Update: I received the second refurbished phone today. There are a few minor scratches on the face, but no big deal. Battery life on this phone is 93%. This phone also has the same issues as the 1st phone I returned. It has low speaker volume and this one also has a lower speaker phone volume than normal. I spent an hour on the phone with Apple support. They were unable to help fix this issue because it was a hardware issue. Needless to say this phone is also being returned. I will not be purchasing a phone from this company again.<br /><br />  I bought this renewed phone which stated excellent condition. There were scratches on the screen, with one deep scratch on the bottom left. Which was really no big deal as it didn’t interfere with the phone. On excellent condition phones, it states battery life at 80% or above. This phone had 77% battery life. It has low phone volume. When making a call it’s extremely hard to hear who your talking to with the ear speaker. The only way I was able to talk to people was using the speaker phone. This is the reason I’m sending it back. I will give them one more try and reorder another phone. 🤞',\n",
