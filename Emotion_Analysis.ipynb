I spent an hour on the phone with Apple support. They were unable to help fix this issue because it was a hardware issue. Needless to say this phone is also being returned. I will not be purchasing a phone from this company again.<br /><br />  I bought this renewed phone which stated excellent condition. There were scratches on the screen, with one deep scratch on the bottom left. Which was really no big deal as it didn’t interfere with the phone. On excellent condition phones, it states battery life at 80% or above. This phone had 77% battery life. It has low phone volume. When making a call it’s extremely hard to hear who your talking to with the ear speaker. The only way I was able to talk to people was using the speaker phone. This is the reason I’m sending it back. I will give them one more try and reorder another phone. 🤞',\n",

Bought it as so called &#34;NEW PHONE&#34; for over $200. Doesn't work anymore and the seller wouldn't do a thing to resolve the problem. The worse part of it was that the seller (Karen), a very shady seller in my opinion, at the first sign that there was an issue, blocked me from leaving feedback. So I in turn contacted Amazon directly to complain. Buyer beware....I won't buy another item from SUPREME DEALS 18.... EVER!!!!!!!!!\n",
              "76     Had this phone for 1 month when I got the message there was no memory available for any pictures.  The pictures had been switched to this phone from a 4S.  S L O W.  Youtube videos won't load.  Some websites won't load on ANY wifi.  This is the third iphone I have had and I HATE it.  Took it to the Apple store, but they said it should work fine once I deleted the pictures.  I downloaded the pictures from the cloud (I have 25GB storage on the cloud, but that still does't help because if you delete a picture on your phone, it deletes on the cloud as well.  So, you have to download pictures from the cloud, then store them somewhere (on computer or stick or SD), then go back and delete EVERY SINGLE PICTURE.  I DID this, yet the youtube videos still won't load or play.  Go with an Android.  They are now better quality.\n",

The issue is when the phone came out it took amazing picture but after some time and multiple updates / upgrades to latest iOS the quality went down. Same with performance.\n",

So I got my phone (iPhone 6s) off of Amazon 2 years ago. I had no problem with it.. until it just got too old. So I decided to buy i new phone( iPhone 8) because i needed more storage. And boom I found this one. I was really scared to buy it because obviously on every other post it talks about how bad they are. I was scared with this one because there was no reviews. I was horriblely scared since I got my iPhone 6s and it was perfect. I have no complaints about this iphone 1 it came fast ( don’t have prime) 2 no cracks or scratches. And yes there is 256 gbs 😍 so I am just happy happy !!\n",

It has never Worked correctly. It freezes up, it will randomly dial somebody, call someone or text somebody. Sometimes he cannot even answer it when he pushes the answer button it won’t slide open. It’s very frustrating to himself and to me when I’m trying to get a hold of him and I can’t because he can’t answer his phone. Money down the drain.\n",
